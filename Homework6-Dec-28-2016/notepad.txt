1) Different types in css? 
	Three different types of CSS styles exists:
	Inline CSS: 
				-By using inline css, styles can be applied to a specific tag. 
				-Inline css are mentioned in opening tag of the required tag by using "style" attribute
				-eg: <p>Color of apple is <em style="color: red;">red</em></p> 

	Internal CSS (embedded css)
				- Using Internal CSS, we can apply same style to specific elements throughout the document by making style declaration only once in the <head> section 
				- All the CSS decorations or stylings should be listed in <style> tags within <head> section.
				-If we wish to represent a particular element in a specific style then Internal CSS would be much helpful. 
				e.g: body{
							background-color: orange; 
						}

	External CSS
				- Used to apply same styles to multiple web pages.
				- Stylings are maintained in a separate file with ".css" extension
				- This external file is linked to the html file using <link> tag in the  	head section.
				- eg: <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">	

2) What is cascading in css? 
	-Each type of the css add its own theme to the html web page.
	-Cascading means sequence of styles. 
	-It helps to apply most recent style by overriding the styles which are defined earlier if multpile styles are declared for a element or section. 
	-styles are cascaded in the order they appear.

3) Why do we need to use css? 
	CSS mainly concentrates on how data looks on the web page. 
	It adds stylings or decoration to the plain text or page to make it attractive. 

4) Which type of css is a better practice? 
	External CSS is a better practice than other types. 
	External CSS: It is useful when we want apply same styles to multiple web pages (					recommended)
			Advantages:
				-High page optimization
				-separates content from decorations
				-eliminates duplication of code.

	Internal CSS: Useful to apply specific style to a webpage.

	Inline CSS: useful to apply unique style to a tag or element.
			Disadvantages:
				- If we want to style multpile paragraph elements in the same way, then we have write styles for each and every paragraph. Thus needs more coding, thus increases bandwidth
				-low page optimization

5) What are selectors and why do we need them in css?
	CSS follows set of rules to identify which styles to be applied to which elements in the HTML web page. These are known as "Selectors". 
	-Inshort selectors identifies elements or tags which need to be styled.
	-Some of the CSS selectors are .class, #id, <tagName>, and more.
