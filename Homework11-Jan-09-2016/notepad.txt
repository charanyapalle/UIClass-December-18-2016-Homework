1) display property values? 
	Display property determines how an element should behave. 
	Inline-> Inline element occupies as much as space it needed. 
		  -> Accepts margin and padding but not height and width
		  ->eg: span, b, em

	Block->Always starts on a new line
		 -> Occupies all the space available to the left and right.
		 ->eg: div, header, footer, form

2) display none and visibility hidden differences in css? when do you use either one of them? 
	Display none: Is used to hide element without deleting them.
				-> it doesn't occupy its space, it behaves as it doesn't even existed
				-> display: none;

	Visibility hidden: It is used to hide element.
					  -> though the element is hidden, it occupies its space allocated.
					  -> visibility:hidden;

3) css box model? 
	CSS Box model is a box which is wraps an element. It consists of 
		-> Content - Actual content or text or image
		-> Padding- Transparent area around the content. 
		-> Border-  Border goes around the content and padding. It is visible
		-> Margin- Transparent space around the border of the element 
		-> eg: div {
					    width: 250px;
					    padding: 10px;
					    border: 10px black;
					    margin: 10px; 
					}
	

4) box sizing in css? 
	Box sizing helps to change the default values of box model. Box- sizing calculates total width and total height in the following ways:

		-> Total width= width of the content + padding + border
		-> Total height= height of the content + padding + border

	box-sizing: content-box
		-> follows the default css box model values i.e; uses width and height values

	box-sizing: border-box;
		-> Uses total width and total height
		-> here elements width and height aren't affected by padding or margins
