1) what are the data types in java script? 
	Java Script has two types of data types.
	Primitive data type
		->String - holds text
		->Number - holds numeric values
		->Boolean- holds boolean values i.e., true or false
		->Undefined- holds undefined value i.e., a variable which has not been assigned a value
		-> null  - holds no value/ null

	Non-primitive data type
		-> Object - comes in "name: value" pairs
		-> Array  - holds groups of similar values
		-> function

2) what are the diff between java and javascript espically in terms of variables? 
	In javascript, variables have two different scopes i.e;
		-> local scope  - these variables are local to a function, where they are declared using "var" keyword
		-> global scope - these variables available globally i.e., through out the web page. Declared without a "var" keyword.

		syntax: 
			var name = value-expression;

	In Javascript, "local" variables have function scope, not block scope.
	
	Java- variable data types must be declared 
	JavaScript- variable data types are not declared		

3) why do we use javascript in web pages? 
	JavaScript is a scripting language which provides user interactivity with webpages. It is also used for:
		- client-side validation
		- manipulation of webpage elements
		-loads the page content without refreshing(reloading) the page - AJAX


4) how to include javascript into webpages? 
	Javascript is included into HTML documents in <script> tags. 
		- Script tags can be placed in the <head> or <body> tags.

5) where to include java script in webpages and why?
	They can be placed in the following ways:

	<head>- If javascript is added here, script compilation occurs even before code is loaded. Thus increase page load time.
	<body>- If javascript is added at the bottom of the <body> section, script compilation occurs after the page is fully loaded.
	 	- thus improves page optimization.
