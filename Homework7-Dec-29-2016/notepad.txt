1) what is the differences between id, class, attribute, tagName selectors and differences between them, when to use what? 

CSS uses selectors to determine which element should be styled. 
	tagName- Used to select by given tag name.
			- eg: p {color: blue}

	ID- Id selectors are unique throughout the webpage
		- an element can have only one ID.
		- an ID should be associated to only one element in the web page that is, it can not be reused.
		-class name is referred using "."
		- eg: .className {color: blue}

	Class-Class selectors are not unique
		- An element can have more than one class.
		- a class can be used by multiple elements, thus a class is reusable.
		- Id name is referred using "#"
		- eg: #idName {color: blue}

	Atttribute- attribute selectors are case-sensitive.
		- there are seven diff types of attribute selectors.
		-eg:[attribute]{
				/*css styles goes here*/
			}

2) what is css Specificity? --> explain with all possible examples(of all variations)? 
	-> Specificity determines, which CSS rule should be applied by the browsers.
	-> If two or more selectors are applied to the same element, the one with the higher specificity wins.
	-> If the given selectors have equal specificity value, the latest rule is taken into consideration.
	-> Order of specificity is as follows (lowers by specificity):
			-> Inline styles
			-> IDs
			-> classes, attributes and pseudo-classes
			-> Elements and pseudo-elements

7) adjacent sibiling selectors in css? 
	Adjacent Sibling:
		Syntax:
		selector1+selector2{
		  /*css goes here*/
		  }

	-> Here Selector1 is an element
	-> selector2 is a sibling of selector1 
	-> Adjacent selectors , selects immediate sibling of selector1 of type selector2.

9) varaiations in attribite based selectors?
	General syntax:

			}

		->	[attributeName="abc"] {
			  /* selects elements that have the combination of attributeName with  this exact value */
			}

		->	[attributeName*="abc"] {
			  /* selects elements with given attributeName that contains this value somewhere in it eg: "abc efg" or "efabcgh" */
			}

		->	[attributeName~="abc"] {
			  /* selects elements with given attributeName that has this value in a space-separated list somewhere */
			  /*eg: img[alt~="abc"]=> selects "abc efg", "efg abc" but not "abcefg" (case sensitive)*/
			}

		->	[attributeName^="abc"] {
			  /* selects elements with given attributeName that starts with this value */
			  /*eg: img[alt^="abc"]=> selects "abc efg", "abcefg" but not "Abcefg" (case sensitive)*/
			}

		->	[attributeName|="abc"] {
			  /* selects elements with given attributeName that has this value in a dash-separated list somewhere */
			  /*eg: [fruits|="abc"]*/ selects abc-xyz but not xyz-abc
			}

		->	[attributeName$="abc"] {
			  /*selects elements with given attributeName that value that ends with this */
